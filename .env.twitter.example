# Twitter/X Configuration
# Add these to your main .env file

# For posting tweets (required for TweetButton component)
VITE_TWITTER_API_URL=http://localhost:3002

# For OAuth login (optional - only needed for "Connect Twitter" on Liquidity page)
VITE_TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id_here

# Note: The OAuth Client ID is different from the API Key used in the backend
# To get OAuth Client ID:
# 1. Go to https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard
# 2. Select your app
# 3. Go to "Keys and tokens" tab
# 4. Find "OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret"
# 5. Click "Generate" if not already generated
# 6. Copy the Client ID (NOT the Client Secret - that's for backend only)
